- The `TopPathUpgrades`, `MiddlePathUpgrades` and `BottomPathUpgrades` properties no longer need to be manually specified for `ModTower`s, they will be inferred
  - Same goes for `MaxLevel` in `ModHero`
- Added a `Model.RemoveBehaviors()` extension (no type argument) that simply clears all behaviors
- Fixed a possible visual error with ModSettingFile and ModSettingFolder
