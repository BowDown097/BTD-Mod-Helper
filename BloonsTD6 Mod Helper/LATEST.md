- Added the ability to use a `<!--Mod Browser Message Start-->` markdown comment in release messages to only include information beyond a certain point
- Added checkmark icons for Verified Modders in the Mod Browser
- Fixed issue where Double Cash mode was doubling cash generation it wasn't supposed to
