- Regenerated UpgradeType constants for v36
- Fixed the ModTower Instas blocker not knowing about Beast Handlers and ignoring Primary/Military/Magic only (thanks @Jonyboylovespie)
- Added a stopgap patch onto `Il2CppDetourMethodPatcher_RaiseException` to make "During invoking native->managed trampoline" errors also print their full exceptions
  - This will eventually be removed once MelonLoader fixes it
