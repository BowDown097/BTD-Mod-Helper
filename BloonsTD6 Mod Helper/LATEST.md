- Fixes for BTD6 v42.0

This Mod Helper update will not be able to be made via the in game Mod Browser.

### Note for Modders

A large number of mods will need to be updated for this patch, as the namespace
for `SpriteReference`, `PrefabReference`, and `AudioSourceReference` has been changed from `Il2CppAssets.Scripts.Utils`
to `Il2CppNinjaKiwi.Common.ResourceUtils`.
