# Mod Helper 3.0 Update

A long time in the making, this update finishes the v32.0 fixes for Sprites / Displays and adds a ton of other stuff.

### What's most important to immediately know about installing this update is that it requires [MelonLoader v0.5.5](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/suites/7738215183/artifacts/324586390). See the new [Install Guide](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/wiki/Install-Guide) page for further details.

The most notable 3.0 addition is a revamped <u>Mods Menu</u> and new <u>In-Game Mod Browser</u>, which you can use to view and download mods updated for 3.0 that have been published on GitHub.
See the [3.0 Update Overview](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/wiki/3.0-Update-Overview) page for a more comprehensive list of changes (there's a lot!).

For modders, I've put together a [3.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/wiki/%5B3.0%5D-Migration-Guide) page for information about how to best make use of the new features.


Note that this is not a universal fix for every mod broken by v32.0, many mods will still need to apply similar fixes to the ones done internally in Mod Helper before they'll be working again.

Also, this update has been in public alpha for a couple weeks now, but there still may need to be some hotfix updates within the days following this release. Luckily they'll be easily downloadable from right within your BTD6 game :D

Special thanks to Silentstorm, GrahamKracker, CommanderCat, and chrisroberts777 for doing as much testing as they did!

Hope everyone enjoys <3
