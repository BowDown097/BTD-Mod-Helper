- For modders, .wav files in your project will now be automatically included as embedded resources and loaded into `AudioClips`
  - To directly play a custom sound "MySound.wav", you'd do `ModContent.GetAudioClip<YourBloonsTD6Mod>("MySound").Play()`
  - To use the custom sound in a SoundModel you'd do `soundModel.assetId = ModContent.GetAudioSourceReference<YourBloonsTD6Mod>("MySound")`
- Fixed FileIOHelper.LoadObject<T>
- Fixed Open Local Files Directory button
- Re enabled Monkey Knowledge getting exported from the Game Model
