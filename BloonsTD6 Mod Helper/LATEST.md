- Added an annoying, impossible to miss Popup if you're not using a compatible MelonLoader version
- Fixed issue where Double Cash mode was doubling cash generation it wasn't supposed to
- Fixed Round Set Changer setting
- Fixed sporadic issue with backing out of a Mod Settings menu
- Fixed `OnMenuClosed()` still happening if you pressed Escape too early for the menu to actually close
- Internally switched from `.parent =` to `SetParent` calls to avoid flooding the MelonLoader debug log
- Added the ability to use a `<!--Mod Browser Message Start-->` markdown comment in release messages to only include information beyond a certain point
