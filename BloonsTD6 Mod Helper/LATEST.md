- Added an annoying, impossible to miss (or escape...) Popup if you're not using correct MelonLoader version
- Fixed issue where Double Cash doubled cash generation it wasn't supposed to
- Fixed Round Set Changer setting
- Fixed sporadic issue with backing out of a Mod Settings menu
- Internally switched to SetParent calls to avoid flooding the MelonLoader debug log
